# Dockerizing a Django Project 

============================
Here's the content rewritten in Markdown format, with repeated code parts removed:

This guide covers how to set up a Docker container for your Django project, first using SQLite and then transitioning to PostgreSQL.

## Part 1: Django with SQLite

--------------------------

### 1\. Create a Dockerfile

Create a `Dockerfile` in your project root to define the environment and dependencies.

### 2\. Create a docker-compose.yml file

This file defines and runs your Docker application. For SQLite, you only need a single service.

### 3\. Create requirements.txt

Ensure your `requirements.txt` includes Django and any other project dependencies.

### 4\. Build and Run the Container

```bash
`docker-compose build
docker-compose up`
```

Your Django app should now be running inside the Docker container with SQLite as the database.

## Part 2: Django with PostgreSQL

--------------------------

### 1\. Modify Dockerfile

No changes needed from the SQLite setup.

### 2\. Update docker-compose.yml

Add a `db` service that runs PostgreSQL in a separate container.

### 3\. Update Django Settings for PostgreSQL

In `settings.py`, update the `DATABASES` section to configure PostgreSQL instead of SQLite.

### 4\. Install PostgreSQL Dependency

Add `psycopg2` to your `requirements.txt`.

### 5\. Build and Run the Containers

Use the same commands as in the SQLite setup. After running the containers, your Django application will now use PostgreSQL as the database.

To run migrations:

bash

Copy

`docker-compose exec web python manage.py migrate`

## Summary

-**SQLite Setup**:
    -   Minimal setup with a single container (Django + SQLite)
    -   Suitable for local development
-**PostgreSQL Setup**:
    -   Multi-container setup using docker-compose (Django + PostgreSQL)
    -   Better suited for production-like environments

Both setups allow you to run your Django project inside Docker. You can later scale and modify the setup based on your production needs.
